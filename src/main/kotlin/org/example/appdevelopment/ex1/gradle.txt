### Key Gradle Concepts

- **Build Type:**
  - **Debug:** Includes debugging info and logging; auto-signed with a debug key.
  - **Release:** Optimized, obfuscated, and must be manually signed.

- **Build Variants:**
  - The combination of a build type and a product flavor (e.g., freeDebug, paidRelease).

- **Product Flavor:**
  - Defines variants (e.g., free vs. paid) that can customize resources and features.

- **Dependencies:**
  - External libraries or modules (local or remote) required by the project.

### Android Build Process to Generate an APK

1. **Project Sync:** Gradle reads configuration files and resolves dependencies.
2. **Resource Processing:** Merges resources from different sources.
3. **Compilation:** Converts source code (Java/Kotlin) into bytecode.
4. **Dexing:** Transforms bytecode into DEX files for the Android runtime.
5. **Packaging:** Combines DEX files, resources, and the manifest into an APK.
6. **Signing:** Debug builds use a debug key; release builds require a production keystore.
7. **Optimization:** Tools like zipalign and Proguard/R8 optimize the final APK.

### Essential Gradle Files

- **gradle.properties:**
  - Stores global configuration settings (e.g., memory settings, build flags).

- **settings.gradle[.kts]:**
  - Specifies which modules are included in the project; `.kts` indicates Kotlin DSL.

- **build.gradle[.kts]:**
  - Defines build configurations for the project/module (plugins, Android settings, dependencies, and custom tasks); Kotlin DSL files (`.kts`) provide better type safety and IDE support.
